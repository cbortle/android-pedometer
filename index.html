<p>Ten Thousand Steps is a simple game based on the use of a pedometer on your mobile device. The pedometer runs in the background and awards you points for every step you take. These points can be used in a game that's a cross between an old-school RPG and an interactive narrative. Each steps impacts your in-game character - their stats, their adventures, and their appearance. The game makes walking fun and simple, and encourages you to increase your daily exercise.</p>
